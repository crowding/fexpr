\title{Convert an environment into a ... object, without forcing promises.}
\usage{
env2dots(envir, include_missing = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{envir}{An environment.}

\item{include_missing}{Whether to include "missing" bindings in the dotslist.}
}
\value{
A \link{dots} object.
}
\description{
All bindings in the environment will be copied into a new
\code{\dots} list. Bindings that are promises will be added to the
\dots list without forcing, while other bindings will be wrapped in
an already-evaluated promise.  If `...` exists in the environment,
all bindings it contains will be added to the \dots list. The
output will not be in any particular order.
