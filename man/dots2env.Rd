\title{Take quotations from a dots object and inject them into an environment.}
\usage{
dots2env(d, env = new.env(hash = hash, parent = parent, size = size),
  names = NULL, use_dots = TRUE, append = TRUE, hash = (length(dots) >
  100), size = max(29L, length(dots)), parent = emptyenv())
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{The dots object to use.}

\item{env}{Specify an environment object to populate and
return. By default a new environment is created.}

\item{names}{Which variables to populate in the environment. By
default, will use all names present in the dotlist.  If a name is
given that does not match any names from the dots object, an
error is raised.}

\item{use_dots}{Whether to bind unnamed or unmatched items to
\code{...}. If FALSE, these items are discarded. If TRUE, they
bound to \code{...} in the environment. If items have duplicate
names, the earlier ones are used and the rest placed in "...".}

\item{append}{if \code{TRUE}, unmatched or unnamed items will be
appended to any existing value of '...'. If \code{FALSE}, the existing
binding of \code{...} will be cleared. (Neither happens if \code{use_dots}
is FALSE.)}

\item{hash}{if \code{env} is NULL, this argument is passed to
\code{\link{new.env}}.}

\item{size}{if \code{env} is NULL, this argument is paseed to
\code{\link{new.env}}.}

\item{parent}{if \code{env} is NULL, this argument is paseed to
\code{\link{new.env}}.}
}
\value{
An environment object.
}
\description{
All named entries in the dots object will be bound to
variables. Unnamed entries will be appended to any existing value
of \code{...} in the order in which they appear.
